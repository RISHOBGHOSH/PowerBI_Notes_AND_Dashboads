In this course, instructor Claire Burn dives into Python 3.9, highlighting the new features, improvements, and deprecations packed into this release. Learn about the significant Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) included in Python 3.9, as well as how to distinguish which modules are new (and why they are notable). Discover which modules have been deprecated and why this was necessary. Plus, get tips for overcoming common challenges while porting from Python 2 to Python 3.9, or Python 3.x to Python 3.9.",Course,2021-08-19 20:27 UTC,N/A,false,N/A,
NLP with Python for Machine Learning Essential Training,"With the increased amount of data publicly available and the increased focus on unstructured text data, understanding how to clean, process, and analyze that text data is tremendously valuable. If you have some experience with Python and an interest in natural language processing (NLP), this course can provide you with the knowledge you need to tackle complex problems using machine learning. Instructor Derek Jedamski provides a quick summary of basic natural language processing (NLP) concepts, covers advanced data cleaning and vectorization techniques, and then takes a deep dive into building machine learning classifiers. During this last step, Derek shows how to build two different types of machine learning models, as well as how to evaluate and test variations of those models.",Course,2021-02-23 18:18 UTC,N/A,false,N/A,
Python Code Challenges ,"Want to test your Python skills? These concise challenges let you stretch your brain and test your talents. Instructor Barron Stone shares over a dozen Python challenges, as well as his own solutions to each problem—the majority of which are less than two dozen lines of code. You can tackle each problem using the tools in the Python standard library, or opt for the library of your choice. And since each challenge is self-contained, you can complete the course in any order—and at your own pace. Tune in to get the hands-on practice you need to keep your skills sharp.",Course,2021-01-21 10:55 UTC,N/A,false,N/A,
Python Data Structures and Algorithms,"Software developers know that efficient underlying architecture is essential to the technologies we use every day. Knowledge of data structures and the algorithms which they support helps developers choose the most suitable solution for a given context, making them better programmers who stand out to their company, clients, or prospective employers. In this course, leveraging the Python programming language, instructor Robin Andrews uses a combo of visual, theoretical, and hands-on programming approaches to explain concepts in a fun and accessible way. Robin explains some of the most important data structures such as stacks, queues, and priority queues, and how these are used by search algorithms such as depth-first search, breadth-first search, and the A-star (A*) algorithm. He shows how to trace the execution of algorithms. Along the way, he provides challenges that allow you to test your new skills.",Course,2021-10-22 19:48 UTC,N/A,false,N/A,
